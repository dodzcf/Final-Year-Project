This is a Repository of my Final Year Project in BS (CS).
The "IoT-based Monitoring and Control System for Home Automation" project showcases a comprehensive prototype that encompasses three rooms. Each room is equipped with an IoT device, which includes two LED bulbs and a fan. The fan is powered by a motor. The primary objective of the project was to enable remote control of household electrical appliances. This can be achieved through buttons available on a mobile application or by using voice commands via the mobile application's voice commands module. Additionally, the system allows users to control the appliances using the hardware switch buttons available on the switchboard, which are connected to the IoT device. The application's interface and functionality were specifically tailored to support the Urdu language, in order to cater to the national language of Pakistan.
